Create a REST API for a Store. That should have following features.
Required tasks:

NOTE:   20 products will be Default. -> with different categories :

NOTE:   Products will be two types : 1) Default Products -> never going to change
                                     2) User added Products -> can be updated -> will be deletd automatically after 24hour

NOTE:   USers will be two types :- 1) Registred Users   -   will get API key
                                   2) Non-Registred Users

⏺  Default products never going to change.
⏺  Default products will not be deleted/updated on the database. 
    But if user ( Registed/non-registed ) sent data successfully it will return you the fake deleted product response.
 

⚪  Registed Users having functionality to add their own products in DB and 
    They can updated or Delete only their products.
    They cannot access others products in DB.
    These product will get automatically deleted after 24 hours of their creation.

⚪  Non-Registred Users have aacess to only Default products.
    They can access update/delete/create routes.
    But in actually they can't add/update/delele any product from DB.

{
    IDEA: Use an API key
    -->    I can make two schemas 1) products schema & 2) user schema.
    -->    User should have a key to access these products
    -->    user shema conatains reference to their products only with key
}
